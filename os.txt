System calls:
-------------
	Only file-handling calls: read and write.
	Extra system functions are available via file manipulations within a
	pseudo-filesystem.

Filesystems:
------------
	Virtual filesystem layer exposes only data, no metadata.  Every file is
	just a stream of bits, with an inherent length.  Metadata must be stored in
	another file using a data serialization format, a la camlistore.  Internal
	record-keeping metadata (e.g. inodes in UNIX-style filesystems) are not
	visible to the user through the VFS; finding and keeping track of files
	must instead be done using a hash of the file contents.

	Some special filesystems include a ramfs and a cachefs.  The ramfs ensures
	files never touch a backing store, while the cachefs keeps files in an LRU
	and frees up space when there is pressure to do so.

	Filesystems must carry some well-defined guarantee on consistency.
