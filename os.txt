Filesystems:
------------
	Virtual filesystem layer exposes only data, no metadata.  Every file is
	just a stream of bits, with an inherent length.  No filenames or directory
	structure are inherent to a file.  Metadata must be stored in another file
	using a data serialization format, a la camlistore.  Internal record-keeping
	metadata (e.g. inodes in UNIX-style filesystems) are not visible to the user
	through the VFS; finding and keeping track of files must instead be done
	using a hash of the file contents.

	Some special filesystems include a ramfs and a cachefs.  The ramfs ensures
	files never touch a backing store, while the cachefs keeps files in an LRU
	and frees up space when there is pressure to do so.

	Filesystems must carry some well-defined guarantee on consistency.

Processes:
----------
	A process is an instance of a program binary. Processes serve only to act on
	files.
	
	Mandatory access control is implemented for each process: each process has a
	set of visible files, and child processes have their set of files chosen by
	their parent.  Directory structure is malleable for each process at
	loadtime.  The requested files and their structure are generally specified
	in a well-defined format in the program binary.

	Processes have a private, copy-on-write map of their program binary,
	meaning if a parent process edits the program binary of any running
	process(es) it does not affect any program instance.  The parent
	determines what backing store is used for the CoW instance (must be the
	same or higher tier of storage).

	Processes aim to survive reboots (i.e. have their private COW binary copy
	on a persistent backing store), with ephemeral resources stored on temporary
	filesystems to signify that processes should always check their
	condition before use.

System calls:
-------------
	Only file-handling calls: read and write.

	Extra system functions are available via file manipulations within a
	pseudo-filesystem.  This way a parent process can easily restrict a child
	process to a set of system functions, by only giving it visibility to
	specific system files.

	I/O calls take as parameters the hash of the file in question, the address
	of the string to be read or written, the length of said string, and the
	address they are to be read or written into.  Optional parameters can
	specify the blocking behaviour of the call.  For writes, the call returns
	the new file hash.

IPC:
----
	A system file can be used to turn a shared file into a buffer/pipe, where
	one process is the reader and some other(s) is/are the writer.  A reader
	reads the file starting at address 0, for a certain buffer length, and the
	call blocks until the writer(s) have filled up that many bytes in the
	buffer.  Writers also just arbitrarily write to address 0---the system
	determines the actual address placement for multiple writes in a row.  As
	soon as the buffer length requested by the reader is filled, the call
	returns on the reader and the next call on the writer blocks.
