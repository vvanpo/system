1-to-1 mapping of bytecode <-> language syntax/semantics

	- bytecode hence includes symbol table
	- Build a bytecode compiler to C and/or ELF/SysV
	- Build a virtual machine for ELF/SysV?


Bytecode compiler:

	- Warnings default to compilation error, must be turned off individually to complete compilation with warnings
		- Endian-specific code generates a warning, compiler must be able to catch:
			- word-sized operations on addresses with byte-assigned data, or
			- byte-sized operations on addresses with word-assigned data
